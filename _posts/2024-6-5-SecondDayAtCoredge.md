On day two feelingsgood with my teams and trainer as always 
i have covered GIT on day 2.. i have learned about git what exactly it is...
   

**What is Git**

Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system 
used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source 
code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development. Linus Torvalds created 
Git in 2005 for the development of the Linux kernel.
   
**What is VCS**
A VCS keeps a history of all changes made to a file or directory, so developers can view previous versions of the code, see who made the changes, and revert to an earlier version if necessary..

**Types of Version Control Systems:**

1- Centralized Version Control Systems
2- Distributed Version Control Systems

**Central VCS**
In a CVCS, a central has central location so every devloper connect with central server and make repo,files and write code there every changes and commit the does on a central server...

**Distributed Version Control System (DVCS):**
In a DVCS, each developer has a complete copy of the codebase on their local machine, so they can work on the 
codebase without needing to be connected to a central server. Developers can make changes to their local copy 
of the codebase, commit those changes, and then push those changes to a central server or share them with other developers

**Here are some useful commands for Git**

**git add**-> . If a file is in the staging areabut not committed, it shows with git status. Or if there are no changes it’ll return nothing to commit working directory clean

**git commit**->  It’s best practice to include a message with each commit explaining the changes made in a 
commit. Adding a commit message helps to find a particular change or understanding the changes
 
**git status**->  This command returns the current state of the repository. git status will return the current 
working branch. If a file is in the staging area, but not committed, it shows with git status. Or, if there are no changes it’ll return nothing to commit, working directory clean
  
**git config**-> 
 
**git branch**-> To determine what branch the local repository is on, add a new branch, or delete a branch.
 
**git checkout**-> To start working in a different branch, use git checkout to switch branches
 
**git merge**-> Integrate branches together. git merge combines the changes from one branch to another branch  
For example, merge the changes made in a staging branch into the stable branch
 
**git clone**-> use git clone to copy and download the repository to a local system.
 
**git pull**->

**git push**->
