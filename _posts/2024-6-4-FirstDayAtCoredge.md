**Here are the questions**

1- **Diffrence between Open source and FOSS?**

Open Source Software is something that you can modify as per your needs, and share with others
without any licensing violation burden. When we say Open Source, the source code of the software 
is available publicly with Open Source licenses like GNU (GPL) which allows you to edit the source 
code and distribute it. Read these licenses and you will realize that these licenses are created to help us.

**What is FOSS (free open source software)?**

Free and open-source software (FOSS) allows users and programmers to edit, modify or reuse the softwareâ€™s source code. This gives developers the opportunity to improve program functionality by modifying it.

2- **What is monolithic?**

In software engineering, a monolithic application is a single unified software application which is
self-contained and independent from other applications, but typically lacks flexibility.[1] There are 
advantages and disadvantages of building applications in a monolithic style of software architecture, 
depending on requirements.[2] Monolith applications are relatively simple and have a low cost but their 
shortcomings are lack of elasticity, fault tolerance and scalability. [3]Alternative styles to monolithic 
applications include multitier architectures, distributed computing and microservices...

3- **What is Operating System?**

An operating system or OS is system software that works as an interface between hardware components and 
end-user. It enables other programs to run. Each computer system, whether it is desktop, laptop, tablet, 
or smartphone, all must have an OS to provide basic functionalities for the device. Some widely used operating 
systems are Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, iOS, etc.


4- **What is Karnel?**

Kernel is the core part of an OS(Operating system); hence it has full control over everything in the system. 
Each operation of hardware and software is managed and administrated by the kernel.
It acts as a bridge between applications and data processing done at the hardware level. 
It is the central component of an OS.
It is the part of the OS that always resides in computer memory and enables the communication between 
software and hardware components.
