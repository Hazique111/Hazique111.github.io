hello hazique
It's day one as a Linux Admin Trainee at Coredge and it is a great day!
I learned about the github by satya my trainee and Mohit my collegue. 
The team is helpful, and I’m excited to learn more and get better at my job!
I have learned some basics about the Github like how to make repository
and how to make changes in the github repo,etc.

It's day two as a Linux Admin Trainee at Coredge, feeling good!
I have some answers of the questions asked by Satya like

Q1-> What is the difference between Open Source and FOSS ?

Ans-> Open Source means sharing the technical code or content in particular community, community used it,
modify it, and make changes if there is a need or find
any bug or the code is having any loophole and again share with a 
particular community to use it.

FOSS(Free and open source software).
FOSS is also used for the same purpose like sharing the code of the software  ans ensuring users to 
use it and improve the code if there is any loophole modify it and share it back to a particular community.

**Day 3 at coredge**
**2024-06-05 Going to learn about git**
**what is git?**
  Git is a free, open source distributed version control system tool designed to handle everything from small to very large 
  projects with speed and efficiency. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to develop Linux Kernel. Git has the functionality, 
  performance, security and flexibility that most teams and individual developers need.
  Git is a Distributed Version Control tool that supports distributed non-linear workflows by providing data assurance for 
  developing quality software. Before you go ahead, 

**What is Git– Why Git Came Into Existence?**
 **Version Control** is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large websites and other collection of
     information.
    Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later
    There are two types of VCS:
**• Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)**
**• Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**
 **Centralized VCS**
   Centralized version control system (CVCS) uses a central server to store all files and enables team collaboration. It works on a
   single repository to which users can directly access a central server.
 **Disadvantage of CVCS**
  • Itisnot locally available; meaning you always need to be connected to a network to perform any action.
  • Since everything is centralized, in any case of the central server getting crashed or corrupted will result in losing the
    entire data of the project
 **Distributed VCS**
    These systems do not necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project file.
    In Distributed VCS, every contributor has a local copy or “clone” of the main repository i.e. everyone maintains a local
    repository of their own which contains all the files and metadata present in the main repository.
 **Advantages of Distributed VCS**
     Committing new change-sets can be done locally without manipulating the data on the main repository. Once you
     have a group of change-sets ready, you can push them all at once.
     If the central server gets crashed at any point of time, the lost data can be easily recovered from any one of the
     contributor’s local repositories.
  **Git Useful Command**
      **git add**-
      git commit
      git status
      git config
